# holbertonschool-web_react

All the project is made to learn how use the framework REACT.

I already use node JS, so i know the syntax. With those projects, I learn:
- Typescript, to give to each function the type of each variables and return, and avoid some issues with my code.
- Webpack, it is possible to have the package.json with ``` npx create-next-app ```, but I can make my own configuration with webpack and install all plugins that I need for a specific project.
